## StyledPlayerList (1.2.1) fixing to work with CTS tutorial:
As I don't know if I'm allowed to share modified jar file, you can read steps on how to modify it to work with CTS there:
1. Download [StyledPlayerList 1.2.1](https://modrinth.com/mod/styledplayerlist/version/1.2.1).
2. Rename .jar to .zip and extract the mod files.
3. Remove `"ServerPlayNetworkManagerMixin"` from mixins in fabric.mixins.json
4. Archive everything back and don't forget to change .zip back to .jar.
